Playing with parallax and hero images

Did 2 different kinds of parallax tutorials at w3schools (https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_parallax.asp) and Solodev (https://www.solodev.com/blog/web-design/how-to-create-a-parallax-hero-image.stml) then started playing around with them, trying to learn how to do it and how to combine the two.  The first has fixed backgrounds and content that scrolls over them (looks really cool) and the other has Jquery movement on the two, making them scroll at different speeds.  The ones I combined kind of work but need more tweaking.
